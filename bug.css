The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur due to unit inconsistencies or operator precedence issues. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width. Another common mistake is forgetting to add spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions, which can lead to errors.
